# Command line for the win

This project is about a CMD CHALLENGE, which is a pretty cool game that challenges one on his or her Bash skills.

### This was how it was done:
After completing the command-line challenge online:
- Following the instructions per the task, I took the screenshots and named them accordingly
- I logged in to my intranet and on the pane, searched for the sandox icon and clicked on it
- I woke up one of the images of the sandbox, specifically Ubuntu 20.04, clicked on the SFTP icon which automatically copied the credentials.
- I then came to my local machine and openned command prompt then pasted the contents copied in there and hit ENTER
- The command prompt then requested for a password which I came back to the sandbox page and copied the password. I then pasted it and hit ENTER again and the connection or pipe was set.
- I then navigated to root then to the said directory to which the files were to be put in.
- With the put command and the complete path to each of the files, the was able to move the files from my local machine to the directory which I then confirmed from the sandbox's page by navigating to the directory to which the operation was made.
- I then added the files then committed it over there(the sandboxes page) and pushed the changes to my remote repository.
- I came to my WSL on my local machine and cloned the repository so I can edit the README file the describe the process I followed to complete the task, to which you are presently reading...
