It's all about an Introduction to Configuration Management


## Introduction

Configuration management (CM) is the systematic handling of changes to a system, ensuring its integrity over time. In the IT industry, it primarily refers to server configuration management.

Automation is crucial in this process, using tools to reach a predefined state via provisioning scripts. These tools are often referred to as Automation Tools or IT Automation Tools.

Server Orchestration, or IT Orchestration, refers to the ability of these tools to manage multiple servers from a central controller machine.

Popular CM tools include Puppet, Ansible, Chef, and Salt, each with its own characteristics but sharing the goal of maintaining a system's state as described in provisioning scripts.

### Benefits of Configuration Management for Servers

- **Quick Provisioning of New Servers**: CM tools allow for rapid deployment of new servers, reducing manual setup time.
- **Quick Recovery from Critical Events**: In the event of a server failure, CM tools enable quick recovery by deploying a previously known good state.
- **Elimination of Snowflake Servers**: CM tools ensure that servers are consistent, eliminating unique and hard-to-replicate configurations (snowflake servers).
- **Version Control for the Server Environment**: CM tools provide version control, allowing for rollbacks and audits of server configurations.
- **Replicated Environments**: CM tools make it easy to replicate a production environment for testing or development purposes.

### Overview of Configuration Management Tools

CM tools use a controller/master and node/agent model, with features such as:

- **Automation Framework**: Provides a framework for automating tasks and defining desired states.
- **Idempotent Behavior**: Ensures that multiple executions of the same configuration do not cause side effects.
- **System Facts**: Gather information about the system for use in configuration management.
- **Templating System**: Allows for the use of templates to define configurations, making it easier to manage and update configurations.
- **Extensibility**: Ability to extend the capabilities of the CM tool through plugins or custom scripts.

### Choosing a Configuration Management Tool

Factors to consider include:

- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Some tools are better suited for complex environments, while others are more straightforward.
- **Learning Curve**: The ease of learning and using the tool is an important consideration.
- **Cost**: Consider the cost of the tool, including licensing fees and support.
- **Advanced Tooling**: Some tools offer advanced features that may be necessary for specific use cases.
- **Community and Support**: Consider the size and activity of the community, as well as the availability of support resources.

### Overview of Popular Tools

- **Ansible**: Uses YAML, no specialized software required for nodes, no centralized control.
- **Puppet**: Uses Ruby, requires specialized software for nodes, centralized control via Puppet Master.
- **Chef**: Uses Ruby, requires specialized software for nodes, centralized control via Chef Server.

### Next Steps

Hands-on experience with Ansible, Puppet, and Chef in a series of guides.

### Conclusion

CM improves server integrity over time by automating processes and tracking changes. Future guides will delve deeper into the practical implementation of CM tools.
